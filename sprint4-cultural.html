        <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
                
                <p>Let’s start with a clear definition It is the innate ability of every brain to create neural networks after being 
                   subjected to new experiences, giving rise to endless skills and changes that until now were considered impossible. 
                   This characteristic allows a wide flow of benefits for people, since it is empirically proven that the brain can be shaped, 
                   readjusted and even generate new neurons in different parts of the cerebral cortex. This causes, therefore, the possibility of stopping degenerative diseases, treating injuries,
                    or treating psychological pathologies such as depression, anxiety disorders and other psychic problems.
                </p>
                        
                <p><i><b>This is a list of some benefits of neuroplasticity</b></i></p>
                
                    <li>Helps postnatal neural development (The normal postnatal development of the nervous system is a programmed expression of neuroplasticity
                        that can be affected externally and internally.</li>
                    <li>It can reorganize the nervous system to replace lost functions.</li>
                    <li>Develop leadership skills and Increase decision-making effectiveness.</li>
                    <li>Enrich creative channels.</li>
                    <li>It allows an increase in the ability to adapt to new territories, therefore, the chances of survival also increase,
                        including accidents and damage caused by attacks on brain tissue.</li>
                    <li>It allows us to produce new connections between neurons and make more solid 
                        those that are already connected.</li>
                    <li>Key to the development of many new and more effective treatments for brain damage, whether as a result of a traumatic injury, a stroke,
                        age-related cognitive decline, or any degenerative disease (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's ...) even if of cerebral palsy.</li>
                    <li>It offers the possibility to optimize performance and human capabilities.</li>
                    <li>The rehabilitation of cognitive functions sustains losses caused by brain damage.</li>

            <h3>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h3>
                
                <p>This new learned concept, I would like bring to my own engage in same way how I take my sessions of CrossFit, 
                   I’m a big fun of this sport and I know if you don’t training at least 3 times per week, is hard to make grow you muscle or beat timings,
                   so this is the idea treat my brain like as new muscle what I need to train every day with just a simple exercises suggested in the next question below.
                </p>
          
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
                <p>In the web is a huge list and suggestions of habits to increase your neuroplasticity but I would like focussing in
                   this list because is the more repetitive and make more sense to me.</p>

              <h4>Get enough quality sleep.</h4>
                    <p>Sleeping is a restorative activity in every sense: it consolidates memory, regulates every body system and improves mood. In case of not sleeping enough hours, 
                       the cognitive function is negatively affected, there is a lower quality and quantity of attention, learning and creative thinking, and the mood becomes more labile.
                    </p>
                
                <h4>Education or mental activity.</h4>
                    <p>Staying mentally active throughout life through learning has been linked on many occasions to good mental health. Exercises such as sudoku or 
                       crosswords are alternatives that help improve cognitive functioning, reducing the incidence of disorders such as Alzheimer's. This is because mental activity, 
                       the creation of new neuronal connections, becomes a reinforcement against brain pathologies.
                    </p>

                <h4>Meditation</h4>
                    <p>this activity helps not only to reduce the incidence of mood disorders, but also to produce a greater white matter by connecting different regions 
                       of the brain and improving attention and concentration.
                    </p>

                <h4>Find a strong purpose for what you’re planning to learn.</h4>
                    <p>Dr Michael Merzenich, author of Soft-Soft-Wired: How the New Science of Brain Plasticity Can Change Your Life says that brain change will be more significant if 
                       you’re motivated and alert. If you find a good reason for learning, then you will try harder and focus more on the task. This has been found to enhance neuroplasticity.
                    </p>

                <h4>Physical activity</h4>
                    <p>Exercise is strongly related to brain health and optimal cognitive functioning. In numerous scientific studies the constancy of some physical activity has been related to the 
                       increase in the gray matter of the brain, resulting in a greater performance in memory, attention and thought tests. It also increases the ability to generate neurons in the 
                       hippocampus, the main region for learning and experiential memory, which in turn reduces the risk of developing neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's or emotional disorders such as depression.

        <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>   
        <br> 
            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
                     <p>The concept of a growth mindset was developed by psychologist Carol Dweck and popularized in her book, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success. In recent years, many schools and educators have started using
                          Dweck’s theories to inform how they teach students.
                          A mindset, according to Dweck, is a self-perception or “self-theory” that people hold about themselves. Believing that you are either “intelligent” or “unintelligent” is a simple example of a mindset.
                          People may also have a mindset related their personal or professional lives—“I’m a good teacher” or “I’m a bad parent,” for example. People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets, according to Dweck, but they can have profound effect on learning achievement,
                         skill acquisition, personal relationships, professional success, and many other dimensions of life.
                    </p>   
                <h4>Why does it matter, anyway?</h4>
                    <p>How we interact and encourage students affects their attitudes toward learning. A positive mindset is the difference between a student giving up because they’re “not a math person” and a productive struggle 
                       that yields growth. But a growth mindset isn’t just about effort. Dweck writes, “In the fixed mindset, everything is about the outcome. If you fail—or if you’re not the best—it’s all been wasted. 
                       The growth mindset allows people to value what they’re doing regardless of the outcome. They’re tackling problems, charting new courses, working on important issues. Maybe they haven’t found the cure for cancer,
                       but the search was deeply meaningful,” (Dweck, 2015).</p>

            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
                    <p>These two new concepts are totally new to me, I would have liked to know about them a long time ago, maybe I could have avoided the rejection of a couple of 
                       challenges by a predisposed mind to a fail.</p>

            <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
                    <p>From now on I’ll try change that predisposed mind (I know is not an easy job) and try think that every 
                       effort has a prize.</p>
