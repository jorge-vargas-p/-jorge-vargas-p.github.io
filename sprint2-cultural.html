          <h1>Learning plan</h1> 
            <br>
            <h2>My learning agreement.</h2>
            <p> The first thing Iâ€™ll do is try to stick to the time box suggestions during the next sprints, try to not be frustrated quickly and take breaks every half an hour. Also, I would like to not feel worried to ask for help from my facilitator and participate more actively in slack (at least once a week) e.g. by answering some questions or making a positive comment or maybe try to explain something I have learned during the day to a non-tech-savvy friend.
                   <p> My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way is:</p>
            
            <ul>&#9824; Google </ul>
            <ul>&#9824; Slack </ul>
            <ul>&#9824; My Facilitator </ul>
<hr>
            <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h2>
            <p>From my facilitator I expect the guidance necessary to resolve problems, not the answers to the problems.</p>
 <hr>           
            <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
            <p>I have already blocked the 15 weeks in my google calendar, so I would not have problems to assist to classes and finish my sprints on time. However, I would like to be able to exercise 3 times a week (during lunch-break or in the evenings) and spend some time with my family, e.g. one day on the weekend and one afternoon during the week. I might also need to drop my daughter at daycare at 8.30am, which should not affect the 9am start for study.</p>
