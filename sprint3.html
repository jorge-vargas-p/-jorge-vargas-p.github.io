            <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
          <p>I like an analogy of the houses using these 2 concepts. To build a house we need the structure first and that is <strong>HTML</strong> we design how we want to have the rooms, doors, windows etc.
             <strong>CSS</strong> is all the nice views of the house, for example, painting walls, what kind of decorations I would like to have, colour of carpets etc.</p>
            
            <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h3>
            <p>The term control flow refers to the order in which the instructions in your program are executed.  Loops are a really fundamental concept in programming. A loop is essentially something that will continue to repeat until a certain condition is met (i.e. until a certain condition becomes true). </p>
            <h4><em>Real Life example:</em></h4>
            <p>Leaving the house with my daughter I learn this lesson after so many times when we went somewhere, I always end up missing something from her nappy bag (either spare clothes in case something happens, nappies, cream etc..). I got so tired of this situation constantly happening to me, that I created a control flow (checklist) of things I have to do before I leave the. This is the list:
                    </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Find Matti’s bag</li>
                    <li>Add nappies</li>
                    <li>Check if there is Nappy rash cream</li>
                    <li>Add spare clothes</li>
                    <li>Fill bottle with water</li>
                    <li>Put the bottle in the bag</li>
                    <li>Find her Dolly</li>
                    <li>Put Dolly in the bag</li>
                </ol>
            <p>So, if for any strange reason some of this element from this list is not met or does not appear inside of the bag, there is when Mr Loop appear because I know I can’t leave the house without one of this element inside of the bag.</p>

            <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
            <p>The Document Object Model is a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The document can be further processed and the results of that processing can be incorporated back into the presented page.</p>

            <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
            <p>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects is the quality and the kind of information we can get when we call this tool. Array is a list of information not specifically displayed on the screen e.g. the way how our phone saves information about our contacts list:</p>
                <p><b>friends [ John 022055456, Peter 021698749, Diego 012345678] </b></p>
                <p>You can access the information by pointing to a specific item in the array e.g. friends[0] will give you contact information for John.</p>
                <p>Objects save information with more properties or more specific details e.g. taking the same example from before</p>
                <p><b>John = { </b></p>
                          <li><i>Phone: 022055456</i></li>
                           <li><i>‘thisis@example.com’</i></li>
                           <li><i>Address: ‘anotherexample 456’</i></li>
                                    <p><b> };</b></p>  
                <p>And we can get the information more detailed. For example, if we only want to get the address of John, we only need to go to our Address section of our contact details e.g.</p>
                 
                <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
                <p>A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in a program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again. You can recall an existing function e.g. by typing functionname( );</p>
