            <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
                <p>I spend many hours in the last kata Built-in Methods when the box suggestion said just 4 hours (LOL).
                   Especially in deBee.test, I could say my problem was the syntax of the code. I knew I had to filter out all 
                   the buzz words and no matter of its case (Upper or Lower). But it was really hard for me to try find the syntax of this code. 
                   Just to filter the words and then make all the rest of the words in lower case.
                </p>
            
            <h2>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
                <p>I used google most of the time, but also using pseudocode was really important. I feel really sure writing or 
                   trying to write, what it is going to be the steps to fix the code.</p>

            <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
                <p>I felt really frustrated a lot of the time, not a nice sensation because I just noticed the time running out and my problems are solved. 
                   I hope this is part of the process and with time, I think I will have more control of this.   </p>

            <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
                <p>Patience. Read more in details once I get the error message.</p>
                            

            <h1>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem-solving techniques and process:</h1>
                <h3>• Pseudocode</h3>
                    <p>I like this method because it lets me put all my ideas about the problem in order to sort it out, 
                       and divide the big problem in little ones.</p>
                <h3>• Trying something</h3>
                    <p>One of the first things I did, once I saw the entire problem for the first time just to
                       try see what is the error for.</p>

                <h3>• Rubber ducky method</h3>
                    <p>I have to be honest and say that I haven’t used this method yet. I wonder if thinking out 
                       loud about the problem and the possible answer counts like a rubber duck technique.</p>

                <h3>• Reading error messages</h3>
                    <p>I am learning how important it is to read these messages. You can google it and sometimes 
                       see why are you getting the specific kind of problems.</p>

                <h3>• Console.logging</h3>
                    <p>This method is really helpful for me at the moment, because it lets me see, what exactly is happening and notice if something is broken. 
                       I really like using it and I think I will keep using this method for a long time.</p>

                <h3>• Googling</h3>
                    <p>Well, google can be really powerful and helpful search tool. For the same reason it is important to learn how exactly make questions to google to get helpful answers from this guy.
                       I can say I’m in the part of the process.</p>
                
                <h3>• Asking your peers for help</h3>
                    <p>It is a really hard step to cross, because I don’t     want disturb anybody with problems, but it is something I have been learning during this week when coming
                       to the campus and meeting my future classmates.</p>

                <h3>• Asking coaches for help</h3>
                    <p>I try to use it like my last recourse, but in my experience, it is good because 
                        they show the way to find answers.</p>

                <h3>• Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                    <p>It is something I have been polishing during this process in the sprints. It can be really helpful to clarify even more how do you
                       find the answers to your problems. </p>
