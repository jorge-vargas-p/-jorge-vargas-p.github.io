            <h2>My Values:</h2>
            <h3><u>Honest</u> </h3>

                <p>I think I’m really honest with myself and with the rest of the people. I always say what I think about something, and I believe faithfully in what I do.</p>
            <h3><u>worker</u> </h3>
                <p>When something as a project come to my head, I don't stop until I finish or reach the goal.</p>


                <h3><u>Respect</u></h3>
                <p>I would like to stick to this value together with the previous one. I always try be honest and do that with respect. I think twice what I will say to try not to damage and no offend others. </p>


                <h3><u>Optimistic</u> </h3>
                <p>If something is not working today, I believe it will work tomorrow. I believe that with a fresh head I will be ready to give better ideas to what I need to figure out or sort something out.   </p>
            <hr>
                <h2>My values no yet achieved:</h2>
                <h3> <u>lack of trust</u></h3>
                <p>Sometimes it is really hard to believe in myself, and many times people notice that as well, knowing sometimes I have the capacity to take challenges.</p>
                <h3><u>Anxiety</u></h3>
                <p>When something doesn’t work, how I was expecting, I start feeling anxious, and sometimes it is something affecting against to my temperament. This is something I’m currently working to improve.</p>
                <h3><u>Indecision</u></h3>
                <p>I don’t like to be in a position, where people depend of my decision of something. I think it is the fear to fail. This is also something I’m working hard to improve.</p>

            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
            <p>During this last 15 years working in the hospitality industry as a chef, I had been working in different kitchens and with different kind of people. One particular situation makes me feel proud about my values. Some time ago “somewhere” I was working crazy hours. That week was summer time, (the busiest part of the year) and my boss (head chef) was this kind of person who was losing patience very quick and in very bad terms. He was throwing away plates or food, basically anything on his way (not very rare behaviour in this industry). For me this was nothing new as I have had seen hundred times this crazy and temperamental behaviour under stress, but one day during the same week, this chef was treating very bad, almost crossing the borders of the racism, with another junior chef from another nationality. That situation made me feel really bad, because I’m a foreign as well. At that moment I dropped my knife and stopped working and I shouted to the junior chef: “If you resign right now, I’m going with you!”. He looked at me very surprised and we both threw our aprons on the bench and left in the middle of a busy service. The head chef couldn’t believe what we were doing and he start say” I’m not going to pay you, guys, this week” to what I answer…take that money and… #$%^&*<>.
                Well at the end we lost our jobs but I didn’t feel bad at all the opposite, I think the respect for other people is very important because you never know where you will be ending in this life. The situation makes me feel good and proud of my decision, and by the way I still have contact with the junior chef and we make a good friendship.

            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>More than the culture can influence in you, I think it is more related how your family values have influenced you and how you been raised to define your identity. For me the modesty and respect are one of the most important values my family had given me, and now I’m trying to do the same with my daughter.</p>

            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p>Working hard is one of the most important strengths to me. I think with perseverance you can reach the goals in your life. This applies when the thought about to giving up during a situation comes to me.
                    Always try to be optimistic and believe that everything has a solution no matter how long it takes to find out the solution to the problem.
