            <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
                <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify, understand and manage emotions correctly, in a way that facilitates relationships with others, the achievement of goals and objectives, the management of stress or overcoming obstacles.
                        Before any event that happens in your life, emotions, both positive and negative, will be there, and can help you and make you happy or sink into the most absolute pain, depending on how you are able to handle them.
                        People with high emotional intelligence do not necessarily have fewer negative emotions, but when they appear, they know how to handle them better. They also have a greater capacity to identify them and know what they are feeling exactly and also a high capacity to identify what others feel. By identifying and understanding emotions better, they are able to use them to relate better to others (empathy), be more successful in their work and lead more satisfying lives.

            <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
                <p>Your IQ is what determines your competencies and individual capacities, but your EQ determines how you interact and treat people in your life, it shows how you are going to cope with pressures or face the crisis. The difference between these two is that no one can alter his/her intelligence or reasoning abilities, but anyone can learn to handle emotions, to bring success for him.</p>
          
            <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                <p>The EQ is important because through it we are able to motivate ourselves, control our impulses, regulate our moods and empathize with others. It allows us not only to live with those around us, but to survive. It is, in short, the one that controls a large part of who we are.</p>
